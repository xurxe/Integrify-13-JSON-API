4.APR.2019: LOCAL AND SESSION STORAGE

LOCAL STORAGE:
    - when you refresh, the data stays there
    - most important for back end, sometimes for front end too
    - It is application specific
    - used, for example, to store user login credentials (when you log out, the application clears the local storage)

    - setItem
    - getItem
    - clear

- On the browser console:
    - localStorage
    - localStorage.clear()



SESSION STORAGE:
    - Is cleared when you the browser (but survives refresh and restore)
    - otherwise similar to local storage
